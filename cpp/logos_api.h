/**
 * @brief LogosAPI provides a unified interface to the Logos SDK
 * 
 * This class initializes and keeps instances of the client provider and token manager.
 *
 * Marked because this is the object handed across the DLL boundary: the host
 * constructs a LogosAPI and passes the pointer to the UI plugin through
 * PluginInterface::logosAPI. Its constructor caches `&TokenManager::instance()`,
 * so an image that links its own copy of logos_api.cpp caches a DIFFERENT
 * singleton than the one the host wrote the token into. Importing instead of
 * re-linking is what makes the two agree.
 *
 * LOGOS_QT_HOST_API, not LOGOS_SHARED_API, because LogosAPI is owned by THIS
 * library while TokenManager and LogosAPIClient are owned by logos-protocol.
 * While building logos_qt_host_shared the first must be EXPORTED and the second
 * two IMPORTED, and one macro cannot say both in the same translation unit. Off
 * Windows the distinction is moot -- both resolve to default visibility -- which
 * is exactly why getting it wrong would go unnoticed until a Windows build.
 * See logos_shared_api.h in logos-protocol.
